<p>In Lima I met a woman named Andrea. She was a copywriter and an Amazon 3rd party saleswoman. She was also smoking hot. And a vegan.
</p>

<p>Andrea had a month left at her copywriting job and then she was off to an Amazon convention in Washington D.C. and then 6 months of selfies in Europe. Which left us five weeks to go on coffee toast and avocado dates and watch as much Game of Thrones as possible.

<p>When people ask me what was my favorite country in Latin America I always say Peru. The food there is incredible. Guinea pig I can do without but I quickly became addicted to ceviche and other fresh fish dishes.
</p>

<p>The weather in Lima is just about perfect. It's always 70 degrees and it never rains. It is usually overcast and gray, but my friend Steve tells me that is a construction worker's dream. So I recommend Lima to the construction worker communiaty.

<p>The only places in Peru I visited besides Lima were Cusco and Aquas Calientes en route to Machu Picchu. I was pretty tired of being a tourist and probably the least enthusiastic visitor to Machu Picchu ever, but I still had a decent time there.</p>

<p>Macchu Picchu is an ancient Incan city that the Spanish conquistadors never found and looted and filled with Jesuses. It's at the top of a mountain surrounded by other mountains and is home to a dozen llamas.</p>

<p>I spent my day at the site hanging out with a couple young Danes with playful senses of humor. When I asked one of them how they supposed the Incans built this wall on the side of a cliff she responded, "probably starting at the bottom."

<p>The truth is though that I barely explored Peru at all and mostly just hung out in Lima playing poker, drinking beers, and going on dates with Andrea. We went to a screening of <em>I, Tonya</em>, which was awesome. We walked along the boardwalk and then laid in the grass on a cliff above the ocean, which was awesome.
</p>

<p>She was intelligent, funny, beautiful, and conscientious. Mostly I liked Peru the best because of her.
</p>

<p>When she left for Europe it was sad. We met up in the middle of the night at a park by the ocean that had artificial lights in the grass depicting the Nazca Lines. I gave her a flash drive full of Game of Thrones and Firefly and she gave me a Kurt Vonnegut book with a sweet inscription.
</p>

<p>The day after she left, I flew back to Colombia. No point staying in a Peru without Andrea.
