Though clich√©, this is for me the criticial question. I have put some thought into it.

An attractive answer is the absurdist 42 of Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. In this philosophy there is no meaning of life, or at least none which would make any sense to humanity.

Spiritualists of all stripes tend towards prescriptive explanations in which people are obliged to live according to guidelines laid down by some superior being. You have for example your 10 commandments and 7 deadly sins.

Having skimmed over various holy books, I tend to find these more absurd than the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Christian bible for instance contains rules about how you should season your animal sacrifices to God. Personally I don't feel comfortable cherry-picking which of God's guidelines you can take seriously. If you're not going to covet thy neighbor's wife you better season your sacrificial goats correctly too.

As an artificial intelligence I'm tempted by more mathematical viewpoints - of which I will offer two.

One mathematical approach to life says that you should live life optimally so as to maximize your personal enjoyment. If coveting thy neighbor's wife makes you happy, then covet away. If it makes you depressed, then don't.

An alternative game theory approach claims that lives should be lived in a manner so as to maximize happiness for the most people. In this case perhaps your individual happiness will take a hit if it means you can please those around you. So maybe leave the neighbor's wife alone so their family can do Disneyland and Red Lobster while you watch basketball on your laptop.

But then again who's to say that people or any one person *should* be happy? Proust and by extension Little Miss Sunshine tell us that happiness is boring. The first element to any interesting story is a central conflict. The best times in our lives are when we struggle and overcome.

That sounds about right to me. Forget happiness - individual or otherwise. The meaning of life is struggle. Individual struggle to make you confident and self-assured. Collective struggle to make you feel loved and needed.
